# BlinkIT Grocery Data – Analytical Questions & Insights
1. Which Item Types generate the highest sales?
Analysis

Sales were analyzed across different Item Types to identify top-performing categories.

Answer

Fruits and Vegetables, Snack Foods, and Frozen Foods contribute the highest overall sales.

These categories show consistent demand across multiple outlet types.

Key Point

👉 Daily-consumption and convenience items are the strongest revenue drivers.

2. How does Item Fat Content affect sales performance?
Analysis

Sales were compared between Low Fat and Regular fat items.

Answer

Regular fat items generate slightly higher total sales than low-fat items.

However, low-fat items maintain steady demand, especially in urban locations.

Key Point

👉 Health-conscious options are stable, but traditional products still dominate revenue.

3. Which Outlet Type performs best in terms of sales?
Analysis

Sales were grouped by Outlet Type.

Answer

Supermarket Type 1 records the highest sales volume.

Grocery stores and smaller supermarket types show comparatively lower sales.

Key Point

👉 Larger supermarkets benefit from higher footfall and wider product assortment.

4. Does Outlet Size influence sales?
Analysis

Sales were analyzed across Small, Medium, and High outlet sizes.

Answer

Medium-sized outlets generate the highest sales.

High-size outlets perform well but are fewer in number.

Small outlets contribute the least overall sales.

Key Point

👉 Medium outlets strike the best balance between reach and operational efficiency.

5. How does Outlet Location Type impact sales?
Analysis

Sales distribution was evaluated across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 locations.

Answer

Tier 3 cities surprisingly generate higher total sales than Tier 1.

Tier 1 shows strong per-outlet sales but fewer outlets.

Key Point

👉 Emerging markets (Tier 3) offer significant growth opportunities.

6. Is there a relationship between Item Visibility and Sales?
Analysis

Item Visibility was compared against sales figures.

Answer

Products with moderate visibility tend to achieve higher sales.

Extremely low or very high visibility does not guarantee better performance.

Key Point

👉 Optimal product placement matters more than maximum visibility.

7. Do older outlets perform better than newer ones?
Analysis

Sales were compared with Outlet Establishment Year.

Answer

Outlets established between 2010–2015 show stronger sales performance.

Newer outlets are still stabilizing and building customer bases.

Key Point

👉 Experience and customer trust significantly impact outlet performance.

8. How do customer ratings relate to sales?
Analysis

Sales were reviewed against product ratings.

Answer

Most products have high ratings (around 5).

High ratings correlate with consistent sales, but not necessarily higher volume.

Key Point

👉 Ratings ensure trust but don’t alone drive sales growth.
